This is the *official* repository for Crystal Caverns, it's a game! Right now, this game is completely free here on github if you'd like to build from source, or playable via downloadabe binaries. All of which are on [itch.io](). 

**Note:** due to `raylib-rs` not having very good WASM support, this project cannot be safely built into a web project at this time.

# Dependencies
